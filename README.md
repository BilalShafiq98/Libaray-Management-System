A library management system is a software application designed to efficiently manage the operations and resources of a library. Without relying on object-oriented programming (OOP) or data structures, it can still function using more basic programming concepts. Here's a simplified description of a library management system without these advanced concepts:

1. User Interface:
The system would have a simple text-based user interface that allows librarians to perform various tasks such as adding books, checking out books, and managing user records.

2. User and Book Records:
Instead of using complex data structures like linked lists or trees, the system could use basic data structures like arrays or lists to store information about users and books. For instance, two arrays could be used - one to store user information (e.g., name and ID) and another for book information (e.g., title, author, and availability status).

3. Book Checkout and Return:
Librarians can manually update the availability status of books by changing values in the book information array. When a user checks out a book, the system could simply mark the book as "checked out" and associate it with the user's ID. When the book is returned, the status would be changed back to "available."

4. User Management:
Librarians can add new users to the system by appending their information to the user information array. When a user wants to borrow a book, the librarian can manually verify the user's credentials (e.g., by checking a physical library card) and assign them a book.

5. Search Functionality:
Basic search functionality can be implemented using linear search or simple string matching to find books by title, author, or other criteria. This would involve iterating through the book information array.

6. Reports and Overdue Tracking:
The system can generate basic reports by counting the number of books checked out, tracking due dates, and calculating fines for overdue books. Fines can be manually collected.

7. Security and Permissions:
The system could have basic security measures such as login credentials for librarians. Permissions for adding and modifying data can be controlled manually.

8. Backup and Data Management:
Periodic backups of data could be performed manually to prevent data loss. Data could be stored in simple text files or basic databases if available.
